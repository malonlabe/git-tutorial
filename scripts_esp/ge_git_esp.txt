Hello,

Iâ€™ve added your key now to Gitolite server and you should have read access. Because the integration is not implemented yet from git to ClearCase, the write access is prevented from everyone.

Server name is: czc3025gt6.clients.em.health.ge.com
Name of repository is: esp

So the following command should work:
git clone git@czc3025gt6.clients.em.health.ge.com:esp



proxy:

git config --global http.proxy 3.187.157.236:9400

git config http.proxy 3.187.157.236:9400


grep ERROR example.txt | wc -l
REM: this count words ERROR in file example.txt.

- how to use bisect:
git bisect start HEAD origin/initial
